# Star_Explosion_Visual
Trying to visualize how a star explodes in python. Not my best work, but it'll be good.

I like to spend my time watching the night sky. It's the only place where I feel happyness, where I feel free. I love the stars,
and I like the thought of how they explode and form Neutron Stars or Black Holes, or just stay as a ball forever, out of energy forever.
I tried visualising this with pygame, and it turned out OK. Not as great as I wanted it to be, but still. Will maybe get some updates later.

**Run the draw.py file and enter "0" on your first run. It will generate pretty big data, so delete it if you don't need it anymore.**
